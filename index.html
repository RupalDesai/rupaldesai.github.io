							<h1>About me</h1>
							<p>
							<img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
							My name is Rupal Desai. I am currently working at <b >New York City Business Integrity Commission </b> as a Software Developer starting February 2019 to present date.
							My day-to-day work is 90% development and 10% tech support of the agency. Created applications in Salesforce using Lightning web component to collect information for approvals from companies.
							In addition to that, developed front-end application on intranet site based on PHP to streamline data access to eliminate the manual process used by employees.
							Apart from that, I had worked in <b>New York City Department of Finance</b> from June 2018 to December 2018 as a Web developer intern, the duties involve improving the intranet SharePoint website 
							of the agency by rearranging the GUI components, adding new features like email notifications to a team triggered on uploaded document category. Also, added document search feature with file tags and acknowledgment of documents which saves the record of viewers in the back-end. 
							This new feature lead to increase in daily active user by 50%.</p>
							<p>
							I completed <b>Masters in Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology</b> in New Jersey from August 2017 to January 2019 with 3.79 GPA and <b>Bachelors in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai, India</b> from June 2013 to June 2017 with CGPA of 7.69/10. 
							During the course of acquiring the degree, I learnt new programming languages, object-oriented concept, MVC architecture, different data-structures and the use of it. Worked on improving my Java skills through certification exams like <b>Java Programmer certification from Oracle (SE6 Programmer).</b>
							In addition to that, I have enjoyed collaborating and working in teams in projects. It was exciting to be responsible for driving the entire project from conception to successful deployment. Constructive communication within our project team was the key which leads to the timely completion of the projects.
							</p>
							<p> Overall, I feel that my knowledge as a developer and my passion to learn new technologies makes me a good fit for Software Developer role. I will be glad to discuss my abilities and my background in more detail. Can reach out to on LinkedIn.
